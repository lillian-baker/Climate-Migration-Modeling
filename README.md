# Climate-Migration-Modeling
Math Honors Project: Exploring Links between Climate Shocks and Migration
The codes added here were used in my analysis of precipitation data and migration data from the Mexican Migration Project.  For my Math Honors Project, I built a mechanistic model of how people migrate in response to changes in precipitation.  The code is divided into three branches: precip (analysis of precipitation data), MMP (analysis of migration data), and model (construction of toy models and models that incorporate the data).
